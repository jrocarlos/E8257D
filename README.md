# E8257D
Procedure to automate Keysight/Agilent/HP E8257D signal generator calibration with Met / Cal Fluke software calibration

To use this calibration software, Fluke Corpotarion's Metcal Calibration Software is required.

This allows calibration of frequency generation, power level generation, output voltage and reference frequency of the signal generator.

A GPIB-USB converter cable is used for the communication between the software and the signal generator.

The output data is saved in a microsoft excel spreadsheet.
